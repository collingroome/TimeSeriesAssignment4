# TimeSeriesAssignment4

This Assignment was to take a public time series and create different types of forecasting models and pick the best one based of accuracy measures. The time series I chose was Netflix Subscriber counts for each quarter from the years 2013-2024.

Attached is the rmd file with the time series, all the models and forecasts and all the accuracy measures for each one. It also includes explanations for each model and plot that I created.
